# Understanding Social Networks: Leveraging Local Node Features for Structural Profiling

This project explores and analyzes the complex world of graph structures using machine learning techniques. Our primary objectives include:

## Objectives

1. **Link Prediction**: 
   - Predict potential connections within the graph to uncover hidden relationships.
  
2. **Influence Prediction**: 
   - Estimate the influence of nodes within the network to identify key players and influencers.

3. **Community Detection**: 
   - Determine if two nodes belong to the same community, helping to uncover group structures and affiliations.

4. **Clustering**: 
   - Group nodes based on their local properties to reveal underlying patterns and structures within the graph.
